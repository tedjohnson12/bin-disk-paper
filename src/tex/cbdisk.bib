  abstract = {A test particle orbit around an eccentric binary has two stationary states in which there is no nodal precession: coplanar and polar. Nodal precession of a misaligned test particle orbit centres on one of these stationary states. A low-mass circumbinary disc undergoes the same precession and moves towards one of these states through dissipation within the disc. For a massive particle orbit, the stationary polar alignment occurs at an inclination less than 90{$^\circ$}, which is the prograde-polar stationary inclination. A sufficiently high angular momentum particle has an additional higher inclination stationary state, the retrograde-polar stationary inclination. Misaligned particle orbits close to the retrograde-polar stationary inclination are not nested like the orbits close to the other stationary points. We investigate the evolution of a gas disc that begins close to the retrograde-polar stationary inclination. With hydrodynamical disc simulations, we find that the disc moves through the unnested crescent shape precession orbits and eventually moves towards the prograde-polar stationary inclination, thus increasing the parameter space over which circumbinary discs move towards polar alignment. If protoplanetary discs form with an isotropic orientation relative to the binary orbit, then polar discs may be more common than coplanar discs around eccentric binaries, even for massive discs. This has implications for the alignment of circumbinary planets.},

  abstract = {We investigate the evolution of low mass (Md/Mb = 0.005) misaligned gaseous discs around eccentric supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. These are expected to form from randomly oriented accretion events on to a SMBH binary formed in a galaxy merger. When expanding the interaction terms between the binary and a circular ring to quadrupole order and averaging over the binary orbit, we expect four non-precessing disc orientations: aligned or counter-aligned with the binary, or polar orbits around the binary eccentricity vector with either sense of rotation. All other orientations precess around either of these, with the polar precession dominating for high eccentricity. These expectations are borne out by smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of initially misaligned viscous circumbinary discs, resulting in the formation of polar rings around highly eccentric binaries in contrast to the coplanar discs around circular binaries. Moreover, we observe disc tearing and violent interactions between differentially precessing rings in the disc significantly disrupting the disc structure and causing gas to fall on to the binary with little angular momentum. While accretion from a polar disc may not promote SMBH binary coalescence (solving the `final-parsec problem'), ejection of this infalling low-angular momentum material via gravitational slingshot is a possible mechanism to reduce the binary separation. Moreover, this process acts on dynamical rather than viscous time-scales, and so is much faster.},

  abstract = {Some evolved binaries, namely post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) binaries, are surrounded by stable and massive circumbinary disks similar to protoplanetary disks found around young stars. Around 10\% of these disks are transition disks: they have a large inner cavity in the dust. Previous interferometric measurements and modeling have ruled out these cavities being formed by dust sublimation and suggested that they are due to massive circumbinary planets that trap dust in the disk and produce the observed depletion of refractory elements on the surfaces of the post-AGB stars. In this study, we test an alternative scenario in which the large cavities could be due to dynamical truncation from the inner binary. We performed near-infrared interferometric observations with the CHARA Array on the archetype of such a transition disk around a post-AGB binary: AC Her. We detect the companion at ten epochs over 4 yr and determine the three-dimensional orbit using these astrometric measurements in combination with a radial velocity time series. This is the first astrometric orbit constructed for a post-AGB binary system. We derive the best-fit orbit with a semimajor axis of 2.01 {\textpm} 0.01 mas (2.83 {\textpm} 0.08 au), inclination (142.9 {\textpm} 1.1){$^\circ$}, and longitude of the ascending node (155.1 {\textpm} 1.8){$^\circ$}. We find that the theoretical dynamical truncation and dust sublimation radii are at least {\textasciitilde}3{\texttimes} smaller than the observed inner disk radius ({\textasciitilde}21.5 mas or 30 au). This strengthens the hypothesis that the origin of the cavity is due to the presence of a circumbinary planet.},

  abstract = {We consider the dynamics of a protostellar disc in a binary system where the disc is misaligned with the orbital plane of the binary, with the aim of determining the observational consequences for such systems. The disc wobbles with a period approximately equal to half the orbital period of the binary and precesses on a longer time-scale. We determine the characteristic time-scale for realignment of the disc with the orbital plane as a result of dissipation. If the dissipation is determined by a simple isotropic viscosity then we find, in line with previous studies, that the alignment time-scale is of the order of the viscous evolution time-scale. However, for typical protostellar disc parameters, if the disc tilt exceeds the opening angle of the disc, then tidally induced shearing within the disc is transonic. In general, hydrodynamic instabilities associated with the internally driven shear result in extra dissipation that is expected to drastically reduce the alignment time-scale. For large disc tilts the alignment time-scale is then comparable with the precession time-scale, while for smaller tilt angles {$\delta$}, the alignment time-scale varies as (sin {$\delta$})-1. We discuss the consequences of the wobbling, precession and rapid realignment for observations of protostellar jets and the implications for binary star formation mechanisms.},

These advancements include the direct detection of protoplanets embedded in disks, and derived limits on planetary masses in others. Morphological substructures, including: rings, spirals, arcs, and shadows, are seen in all imaged infrared-bright disks to date, and are ubiquitous across spectral types. These substructures are believed to be the result of disk evolution processes, and in particular disk-planet interactions. Since small dust grains that scatter light are tightly bound to the disk's gas, these observations closely trace disk structures predicted by hydrodynamical models and serve as observational tests of the predictions of planet formation theories. We argue that the results of current and next-generation high-contrast imaging surveys will, when combined with complementary data from ALMA, lead to a much deeper understanding of the co-evolution of disks and planets, and the mechanisms by which planets form.},

  abstract = {Context. Transition disks are protoplanetary disks with dust-depleted cavities, possibly indicating substantial clearing of their dust content by a massive companion. For several known transition disks, dark regions interpreted as shadows have been observed in scattered light imaging and are hypothesized to originate from misalignments between distinct regions of the disk. Aims: We aim to investigate the presence of misalignments in transition disks. We study the inner disk ({$<$}1 au) geometries of a sample of 20 well-known transition disks with Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) GRAVITY observations and use complementary 12CO and 13CO molecular line archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to derive the orientation of the outer disk regions ({$>$}10 au). Methods: We fit simple parametric models to the visibilities and closure phases of the GRAVITY data to derive the inclination and position angle of the inner disks. The outer disk geometries were derived from Keplerian fits to the ALMA velocity maps and compared to the inner disk constraints. We also predicted the locations of expected shadows for significantly misaligned systems. Results: Our analysis reveals six disks to exhibit significant misalignments between their inner and outer disk structures. The predicted shadow positions agree well with the scattered light images of HD 100453 and HD 142527, and we find supporting evidence for a shadow in the south of the disk around CQ Tau. In the other three targets for which we infer significantly misaligned disks, V1247 Ori, V1366 Ori, and RY Lup, we do not see any evident sign of shadows in the scattered light images. The scattered light shadows observed in DoAr 44, HD 135344 B, and HD 139614 are consistent with our observations, yet the underlying morphology is likely too complex to be described properly by our models and the accuracy achieved by our observations. Conclusions: The combination of near infrared and submillimeter interferometric observations allows us to assess the geometries of the innermost disk regions and those of the outer disk. Whereas we can derive precise constraints on the potential shadow positions for well-resolved inner disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars, the large statistical uncertainties for the marginally resolved inner disks around the T Tauri stars of our sample make it difficult to extract conclusive constraints for the presence of shadows in these systems.

Previous studies investigated the secular dynamics mainly by approximate analytic methods. In the stationary inclination state, the planet and binary precess together with no change in relative tilt. For both prograde and retrograde planetary orbits, we explore the conditions for planetary orbital libration versus circulation and the conditions for stationary inclination. As was predicted by analytic models, for sufficiently high initial inclination, a prograde planet's orbit librates about the stationary tilted state. For a fixed binary eccentricity, the stationary angle is a monotonically decreasing function of the ratio of the planet-to-binary angular momentum j. The larger j, the stronger the evolutionary changes in the binary eccentricity and inclination. We also calculate the critical tilt angle that separates the circulating from the librating orbits for both prograde and retrograde planet orbits. The properties of the librating orbits and stationary angles are quite different for prograde versus retrograde orbits. The results of the numerical simulations are in very good quantitative agreement with the analytic models. Our results have implications for circumbinary planet formation and evolution.},

Eclipses occur whenever the reflex motion of a star carries it behind the circumbinary ring; the eclipses occur with a period equal to the binary orbital period of 48.4 days. Features of the light curve, including the amplitude of central reversals during mid-eclipse, the phase of the eclipse with respect to the binary orbit phase, the level of brightness out of eclipse, the depth of the eclipse, and the eclipse duty cycle, are all modulated on the timescale of nodal regression of the obscuring ring, in accord with the historical data. The ring has a mean radius near 3 AU and a radial width that is likely less than this value. While the inner boundary could be shepherded by the central binary, the outer boundary may require an exterior planet to confine it against viscous spreading. The ring must be vertically warped to maintain a nonzero inclination. Thermal pressure gradients and/or ring self-gravity can readily enforce rigid precession. In coming years, as the node of the ring regresses out of our line of sight toward the binary, the light curve from the system should cycle approximately back through its previous behavior. Near-term observations should seek to detect a mid-infrared excess from this system; we estimate the flux densities from the ring to be 3 mJy at wavelengths of 10-100 {$\mu$}m.},

A polar-aligned planet has a stable orbit that is inclined by 90{$^\circ$} to the orbital plane of the binary with an angular momentum vector that is aligned to the binary eccentricity vector. With n-body simulations we model polar terrestrial planet formation using hydrodynamic gas disk simulations to motivate the initial particle distribution. Terrestrial planet formation around an eccentric binary is more likely in a polar alignment than in a coplanar alignment. Similar planetary systems form in a polar alignment around an eccentric binary and a coplanar alignment around a circular binary. The polar planetary systems are stable even with the effects of general relativity. Planetary orbits around an eccentric binary exhibit tilt and eccentricity oscillations at all inclinations; however, the oscillations are larger in the coplanar case than the polar case. We suggest that polar-aligned terrestrial planets will be found in the future.},

Although for these systems the true mutual inclinations {\texttheta} between disk and binary cannot be directly measured because relative nodal angles are unknown, the near coincidence of i disk and i {$\star$} suggests that {\texttheta} is small for these most compact of systems. We confirm this hypothesis using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis, showing that 68\% of CB disks around short-period SB2s have {\texttheta} {$<$} 3.{$^\circ$}0. Near coplanarity of CB disks implies near coplanarity of CB planets discovered by Kepler, which in turn implies that the occurrence rate of close-in CB planets is similar to that around single stars. By contrast, at longer periods ranging from 30 to 105 days (where the nodal degeneracy can be broken via, e.g., binary astrometry), CB disks exhibit a wide range of mutual inclinations, from coplanar to polar. Many of these long-period binaries are eccentric, as their component stars are too far separated to be tidally circularized. We discuss how theories of binary formation and disk-binary gravitational interactions can accommodate all these observations.},

This work is the first dynamically aware analysis of the stability of circumbinary orbits across both binary mass fraction and binary eccentricity. This work also has implications for exoplanetary astronomy in the existence and determination of stable orbits around binary systems.},

In this paper, we propose a different point of view on the problem by looking first at the restricted problem where the massless particle is the outer body. In this situation, equilibria at high mutual inclination appear, which corresponds to the population of stable particles that Verrier \& Evans find in stable, high-inclination circumbinary orbits around one of the components of the quadruple star HD 98800. We provide a simple analytical framework using a vectorial formalism for these situations. We also look at the evolution of these high-inclination equilibria in the non-restricted case.},

  abstract = {The Kepler satellite has discovered a number of transiting planets around close binary stars. These circumbinary systems have highly aligned planetary and binary orbits. In this paper, we explore how the mutual inclination between the planetary and binary orbits may reflect the physical conditions of the assembly of protoplanetary disks and the interaction between protostellar binaries and circumbinary disks. Given the turbulent nature of star-forming molecular clouds, it is possible that the gas falling onto the outer region of a circumbinary disk and the central protostellar binary have different axes of rotation. Thus, the newly assembled circumbinary disk can be misaligned with respect to the binary. However, the gravitational torque from the binary produces a warp and twist in the disk, and the back-reaction torque tends to align the disk and the binary orbital plane. We present a new, analytic calculation of this alignment torque and show that the binary-disk inclination angle can be reduced appreciably after the binary accretes a few percent of its mass from the disk. Our calculation suggests that in the absence of other disturbances, circumbinary disks and planets around close (sub-AU) stellar binaries, for which mass accretion onto the proto-binary is very likely to have occurred, are expected to be highly aligned with the binary orbits, while disks and planets around wide binaries can be misaligned. Measurements of the mutual inclinations of circumbinary planetary systems can provide a clue to the birth environments of such systems.},

  abstract = {Warped accretion discs are expected in many protostellar binary systems. In this paper, we study the long-term evolution of disc warp and precession for discs with dimensionless thickness H/r larger than their viscosity parameter {$\alpha$}, such that bending waves can propagate and dominate the warp evolution. For small warps, these discs undergo approximately rigid-body precession. We derive analytical expressions for the warp/twist profiles of the disc and the alignment time-scale for a variety of models. Applying our results to circumbinary discs, we find that these discs align with the orbital plane of the binary on a time-scale comparable to the global precession time of the disc, and typically much smaller than its viscous time-scale. We discuss the implications of our finding for the observations of misaligned circumbinary discs (such as KH 15D) and circumbinary planetary systems (such as Kepler-413); these observed misalignments provide useful constraints on the uncertain aspects of the disc warp theory. On the other hand, we find that circumstellar discs can maintain large misalignments with respect to the plane of the binary companion over their entire lifetime. We estimate that inclination angles larger than {$\sim$}20{$^\circ$} can be maintained for typical disc parameters. Overall, our results suggest that while highly misaligned circumstellar discs in binaries are expected to be common, such misalignments should be rare for circumbinary discs. These expectations are consistent with current observations of protoplanetary discs and exoplanets in binaries, and can be tested with future observations.},

  abstract = {We present an in-depth study of the hard-binary population of the old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188. Utilizing 85 spectroscopic binary orbits out of a complete sample of 129 detected binary members, we study the cluster binary frequency and the distributions of binary orbital elements among the main-sequence (MS), giant, and blue straggler (BS) populations. The results are derived from our ongoing radial velocity survey of the cluster, which spans in magnitude from the brightest stars in the cluster to V = 16.5 (about 1.1-0.9 M {$\odot$}), and extends to a projected radius of 17 pc ({\textasciitilde}13 core radii). Our detectable binaries have periods ranging from a few days to of order 104 days, and thus are hard binaries that dynamically power the cluster. The MS solar-type hard binaries in NGC 188 are nearly indistinguishable from similar binaries in the Galactic field. We observe a global solar-type MS hard-binary frequency in NGC 188 of 23\% {\textpm} 2\%, which when corrected for incompleteness results in a frequency of 29\% {\textpm} 3\% for binaries with periods less than 104 days. For MS hard binaries in the cluster, we observe a log-period distribution that rises toward our detection limit, a roughly Gaussian eccentricity distribution centered on e = 0.35 (for binaries with periods longer than the circularization period), and a secondary-mass distribution that rises toward lower-mass companions. Importantly, the NGC 188 BS binaries show significantly different characteristics than the solar-type MS binaries in NGC 188. We observe a BS hard-binary frequency of 76\% {\textpm} 19\%, three times that of the MS. The excess of this binary frequency over the normal MS binary frequency is valid at the {$>$}99\% confidence level. Furthermore, the BS binary eccentricity-log-period distribution is distinct from that of the MS at the 99\% confidence level, with the majority of the BS binaries having periods of order 1000 days and lower eccentricities. The secondary-mass distribution for these long-period BS binaries is narrow and peaked with a mean value of about 0.5 M {$\odot$}. Predictions for mass-transfer products are most closely consistent with the binary properties of these NGC 188 BSs, which comprise two-thirds of the BS population. Additionally, we compare the NGC 188 binaries to those evolved within the sophisticated Hurley et al. (2005) N-body open cluster simulation. The MS hard-binary population predicted by the simulation is significantly different from the MS hard-binary population observed in NGC 188, in frequency and distributions of period and eccentricity. Many of these differences result from the adopted initial binary population, while others reflect on the physics used in the simulation (e.g., tidal circularization). Additional simulations with initial conditions that are better motivated by observations are necessary to properly investigate the dynamical evolution of a rich binary population in open clusters like NGC 188.},

  abstract = {Context. Many post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars in binary systems have an infrared (IR) excess arising from a dusty circumbinary disk. The disk formation, current structure, and further evolution are, however, poorly understood. Aims: We aim to constrain the structure of the circumstellar material around the post-AGB binary and RV Tauri pulsator AC Her. We want to constrain the spatial distribution of the amorphous and of the crystalline dust. Methods: We present very high-quality mid-IR interferometric data that were obtained with the MIDI/VLTI instrument. We analyze the MIDI visibilities and differential phases in combination with the full spectral energy distribution, using the MCMax radiative transfer code, to find a good structure model of AC Her's circumbinary disk. We include a grain size distribution and midplane settling of dust self-consistently in our models. The spatial distribution of crystalline forsterite in the disk is investigated with the mid-IR features, the 69 {$\mu$}m band and the 11.3 {$\mu$}m signatures in the interferometric data. Results: All the data are well fitted by our best model. The inclination and position angle of the disk are precisely determined at i = 50 {\textpm} 8{$^\circ$} and PA = 305 {\textpm} 10{$^\circ$}. We firmly establish that the inner disk radius is about an order of magnitude larger than the dust sublimation radius. The best-fit dust grain size distribution shows that significant grain growth has occurred, with a significant amount of mm-sized grains now being settled to the midplane of the disk. A large total dust mass {$\geq$}10-3 M{$\odot$} is needed to fit the mm fluxes. By assuming {$\alpha$}turb = 0.01, a good fit is obtained with a small grain size power law index of 3.25, combined with a small gas/dust ratio {$\leq$}10. The resulting gas mass is compatible with recent estimates employing direct gas diagnostics. The spatial distribution of the forsterite is different from the amorphous dust, as more warm forsterite is needed in the surface layers of the inner disk. Conclusions: The disk in the AC Her system is in a very evolved state, as shown by its small gas/dust ratio and large inner hole. Mid-IR interferometry offers unique constraints, complementary to mid-IR features, for studying the mineralogy in disks. A better uv coverage is needed to constrain in detail the distribution of the crystalline forsterite in the disk of AC Her, but we find strong similarities with the protoplanetary disk HD 100546.

With Gaia's high-precision astrometric measurements, eccentricity of a wide binary can be constrained by the angle between the separation vector and the relative velocity vector (the v-r angle). In this paper, by using the v-r angles of wide binaries in Gaia Early Data Release 3, we develop a Bayesian approach to measure the eccentricity distribution as a function of binary separations. Furthermore, we infer the eccentricities of individual wide binaries and make them publicly available. Our results show that the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries at 102 AU is close to uniform and becomes superthermal at {$>$}103 AU, suggesting two formation mechanisms dominating at different separation regimes. The close binary formation, most likely disc fragmentation, results in a uniform eccentricity distribution at {$<$}102 AU. The wide binary formation that leads to highly eccentric wide binaries at {$>$}103 AU may be turbulent fragmentation and/or the dynamical unfolding of compact triples. With Gaia, measuring eccentricities is now possible for a large number of wide binaries, opening a new window to understanding binary formation and evolution.},

The binary orbit is well characterized and we conclude that the disc is misaligned with the binary plane. Two different models can explain the observed structure. The first model is a ring of polar orbits that move in a plane perpendicular to the binary pericentre direction. We favour this interpretation because it includes the effect of secular perturbations and the disc can survive for Gyr time-scales. The second model is a misaligned ring. Because there is an ambiguity in the orientation of the ring, which could be reflected in the sky plane, this ring either has near-polar orbits similar to the first model or has a 30{$^\circ$} misalignment. The misaligned ring, interpreted as the result of a recent collision, is shown to be implausible from constraints on the collisional and dynamical evolution. Because disc+star systems with separations similar to 99 Herculis should form coplanar, possible formation scenarios involve either a close stellar encounter or binary exchange in the presence of circumstellar and/or circumbinary discs. Discovery and characterization of systems like 99 Herculis will help understand processes that result in planetary system misalignment around both single and multiple stars.},

The process of protoplanetary disk formation can result in initial misalignments, where the disk orbital plane is different from the stellar equator in single-star systems, or different from the binary orbital plane in systems with two stars2. A quirk of the dynamics means that initially misaligned `circumbinary' disks---those that surround two stars---are predicted to evolve to one of two possible stable configurations: one where the disk and binary orbital planes are coplanar and one where they are perpendicular (a `polar' configuration)3-5. Previous work has found coplanar circumbinary disks6, but no polar examples were known until now. Here, we report the first discovery of a protoplanetary circumbinary disk in the polar configuration, supporting the predictions that such disks should exist. The disk shows some characteristics that are similar to disks around single stars, and that are attributed to dust growth. Thus, the first stages of planet formation appear able to proceed in polar circumbinary disks.},

  abstract = {Context. Young multiple stellar systems can host both circumstellar and circumbinary discs composed of gas and dust, and the orientations of circumbinary discs can be sculpted by the orientation and eccentricity of the central binaries. Studying multiple binary systems and their associated discs enables our understanding of the size and distribution of the planetary systems that subsequently form around them. Aims: A deep ({\textasciitilde}70\%) and extended ({\textasciitilde}150 days) eclipse was seen towards the young multiple stellar system V773 Tau in 2010. We interpret it as being due to the passage of a circumbinary disc around the B components moving in front of the A components. Our aim is to characterise the orientation and structure of the disc, to refine the orbits of the sub-components, and to predict when the next eclipse will occur. Methods: We combined the photometry from several ground-based surveys, constructed a model for the light curve of the eclipse, and used high angular resolution imaging to refine the orbits of the three spatially resolved components of the system: A, B, and C. A frequency analysis of the light curves, including from the TESS satellite, enabled the characterisation of the rotational periods of the Aa and Ab stars. Results: A toy model of the circumbinary disc shows that it extends out to approximately 5 au around the B binary and has an inclination of 73{$^\circ$} with respect to the orbital plane of AB, where the lower bound of the radius of the disc is constrained by the geometry of the AB orbit and the upper bound is set by the stability of the disc. We identify several frequencies in the photometric data that we attribute to rotational modulation of the Aa and Ab stellar companions. We produced the first determination of the orbit of the more distant C component around the AB system and limited its inclination to 93{$^\circ$}. Conclusions: The high inclination and large diameter of the disc, together with the expected inclination of the disc from theory, suggest that B is an almost equal-mass, moderately eccentric binary. We identify the rotational periods of the Aa and Ab stars and a third frequency in the light curve that we attribute to the orbital period of the stars in the B binary. We predict that the next eclipse will occur around 2037, during which both detailed photometric and spectroscopic monitoring will characterise the disc in greater detail.

We present the final catalog of eclipsing binary systems within the 105 deg2 Kepler field of view. This release incorporates the full extent of the data from the primary mission (Q0-Q17 Data Release). As a result, new systems have been added, additional false positives have been removed, ephemerides and principal parameters have been recomputed, classifications have been revised to rely on analytical models, and eclipse timing variations have been computed for each system. We identify several classes of systems including those that exhibit tertiary eclipse events, systems that show clear evidence of additional bodies, heartbeat systems, systems with changing eclipse depths, and systems exhibiting only one eclipse event over the duration of the mission. We have updated the period and galactic latitude distribution diagrams and included a catalog completeness evaluation. The total number of identified eclipsing and ellipsoidal binary systems in the Kepler field of view has increased to 2878, 1.3\% of all observed Kepler targets.

  abstract = {Tidal friction in close binaries, with periods of a few days, is expected to circularize the orbit on a time-scale long compared with human observation but shorter than, or comparable to, the lifetimes of main-sequence stars. In a hierarchical triple star, however, the perturbing effect of the distant third star may decircularize the inner orbit significantly on a time-scale of the order of days (as in lambda Tau) or centuries (as in beta Per). If the inner pair is observed to be semidetached, however, it is plausible to assume that the eccentricity is small. This may be because tidal friction is operating on a comparably short time-scale, and so it is in principle amenable to observation. We attempt to determine a lower limit to the strength of tidal friction in lambda Tau and beta Per, on the basis of this consideration. Tidal friction will also lead to a secular transfer of angular momentum from the inner orbit to the outer orbit. Too rapid a transfer may lead to orbital shrinkage that is fast compared with the nuclear time-scales of the inner systems, and this can also be ruled out on observational grounds. Thus we may be able to set an upper as well as a lower limit to the strength of tidal friction, on the basis of observations. In a young hierarchical triple, provided that the orbits are fairly nearly orthogonal, tidal friction can serve to reduce the inner orbital period from months to days within a fairly short period of time, of order P{\textasciicircum}2\_out/P\_in. This may be a significant mechanism for producing young short-period binaries.},

When the ratio of the semi-major axes of the asteroid and Jupiter takes a very small value, the solutions are expressed by elliptic functions. When the z component of the angular momentum (that is, Delaunay's H) of the asteroid is smaller than a certain limiting value, there are both a stationary solution and solutions corresponding to libration cases. The limiting value of H increases as the ratio of the semimajor axes increases, i.e., the corresponding limiting inclination drops from 39.2{$^\circ$} to 1.8{$^\circ$} as the ratio of the axes increases from 0.0 to 0.95.},

In the absence of general relativity (GR), the stationary inclination is inclined by 90{$^\circ$} to the binary angular momentum vector (aligned with the binary eccentricity vector) and does not depend on the particle semimajor axis. GR causes apsidal precession of the binary orbit. Close to the binary, the behavior of the particle is not significantly affected, and a librating particle precesses with the binary. However, we find that the stationary inclination and the minimum inclination required for libration both increase with the particle semimajor axis. There is a critical radius beyond which there are no librating orbits, only circulating orbits, and therefore there is a maximum orbital radius for a stationary polar-orbiting body. The critical radius is within planet-forming regions around binaries with a semimajor axis {$\lessequivlnt$}1 au. This has implications for the search for misaligned circumbinary planets and the radial extent of polar circumbinary disks.},

  abstract = {We consider the dynamics of a protostellar disk surrounding a star in a circular-orbit binary system. Our aim is to determine whether, if the disk is initially tilted with respect to the plane of the binary orbit, the inclination of the system will increase or decrease with time. The problem is conveniently formulated in the binary frame in which the tidal potential of the companion star is static. We may then consider a steady, flat disk that is aligned with the binary plane and investigate its linear stability with respect to tilting or warping perturbations. The dynamics is controlled by the competing effects of the m=0 and m=2 azimuthal Fourier components of the tidal potential. In the presence of dissipation, the m=0 component causes alignment of the system, while the m=2 component has the opposite tendency. We find that disks that are sufficiently large, in particular those that extend to their tidal truncation radii, are generally stable and will therefore tend to alignment with the binary plane on a timescale comparable to that found in previous studies. However, the effect of the m=2 component is enhanced in the vicinity of resonances where the outer radius of the disk is such that the natural frequency of a global bending mode of the disk is equal to twice the binary orbital frequency. Under such circumstances, the disk can be unstable to tilting and acquire a warped shape, even in the absence of dissipation. The outer radius corresponding to the primary resonance is always smaller than the tidal truncation radius. For disks smaller than the primary resonance, the m=2 component may be able to cause a very slow growth of inclination through the effect of a near resonance that occurs close to the disk center. We discuss these results in the light of recent observations of protostellar disks in binary systems.},

Significant disc evolution towards the polar state around moderately eccentric binaries can occur for typical protostellar disc parameters in less than a typical disc lifetime for binaries with orbital periods of order 100 yr or less. Resonant torques are much less effective at truncating the inner parts of circumbinary polar discs than the inner parts of coplanar discs. For polar discs, they vanish for a binary eccentricity of unity. The results agree with the simulations in showing that discs can evolve to a polar state. Circumbinary planets may then form in such discs and reside on polar orbits.},

  abstract = {The majority of binary stars do not eclipse. Current searches for transiting circumbinary planets concentrate on eclipsing binaries, and are therefore restricted to a small fraction of potential hosts. We investigate the concept of finding planets transiting non-eclipsing binaries, whose geometry would require mutually inclined planes. Using an N-body code we explore how the number and sequence of transits vary as functions of observing time and orbital parameters. The concept is then generalised thanks to a suite of simulated circumbinary systems. Binaries are constructed from radial-velocity surveys of the solar neighbourhood. They are then populated with orbiting gas giants, drawn from a range of distributions. The binary population is shown to be compatible with the Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue, indicating that the properties of binaries may be as universal as the initial mass function. These synthetic systems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on both eclipsing and non-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing binaries are compared with published Kepler detections. We find 1) that planets transiting non-eclipsing binaries are probably present in the Kepler data; 2) that observational biases alone cannot account for the observed over-density of circumbinary planets near the stability limit, which implies a physical pile-up; and 3) that the distributions of gas giants orbiting single and binary stars are likely different. Estimating the frequency of circumbinary planets is degenerate with the spread in mutual inclination. Only a minimum occurrence rate can be produced, which we find to be compatible with 9\%. Searching for inclined circumbinary planets may significantly increase the population of known objects and will test our conclusions. Their presence, or absence, will reveal the true occurrence rate and help develop circumbinary planet formation theories.},

  abstract = {Transits on single stars are rare. The probability rarely exceeds a few per cent. Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing orbital period. Therefore, transit surveys have been predominantly limited to the inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here, we demonstrate how circumbinary planets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry and the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the probability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet orbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit probability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its minimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an increasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical development to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable, and in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1 au around a 0.3 au eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100 per cent probability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6{$^\circ$}. We show that the transit probability is generally only a weak function of the planet's orbital period; circumbinary planets may be used as practical tools for probing the outer regions of exoplanetary systems to search for and detect warm to cold transiting planets.},

Dissipation within the disk causes the oscillations to damp.

The derived equations are applied to the known transiting circumbinary planets found by Kepler to predict when future transits will occur, and whether they will be observable by upcoming space telescopes TESS, CHEOPS and PLATO. The majority of these planets spend less than 50 per cent of their time in a transiting configuration, some less than 20 per cent.

Dissipation causes evolution towards a stationary state of polar alignment in which the disc lies perpendicular to the binary orbital plane with angular momentum aligned to the eccentricity vector of the binary. We use hydrodynamic simulations and analytical methods to investigate how the mass of the disc affects this process. The simulations suggest that a disc with non-zero mass settles into a stationary state in the frame of the binary, the generalized polar state, at somewhat lower levels of misalignment with respect to the binary orbital plane, in agreement with the analytical model. Provided that discs settle into this generalized polar state, the observational determination of the misalignment angle and binary properties can be used to determine the mass of a circumbinary disc. We apply this constraint to the circumbinary disc in HD 98800. We obtain analytical criteria for polar alignment of a circumbinary ring with mass that approximately agree with the simulation results. Very broad misaligned discs undergo breaking, but the inner regions at least may still evolve to a polar state. The long-term evolution of the disc depends on the evolution of the binary eccentricity that we find tends to decrease. Although the range of parameters required for polar alignment decreases somewhat with increasing disc mass, such alignment appears possible for a broad set of initial conditions expected in protostellar circumbinary discs.},

We present STANLEY, an automated algorithm to find small circumbinary planets. It employs custom methods to detrend eclipsing binary light curves and stack shallow transits of variable duration and interval using N-body integrations. Applied to the Kepler circumbinaries, we recover all known planets, including the three planets of Kepler-47, and constrain the absence of additional planets of similar or smaller size. We also show that we could have detected {$<$}3 R{$\oplus$} planets in half of the known systems.

  abstract = {The hierarchical triple-body approximation has useful applications to a variety of systems from planetary and stellar scales to supermassive black holes. In this approximation, the energy of each orbit is separately conserved, and therefore the two semimajor axes are constants. On timescales much larger than the orbital periods, the orbits exchange angular momentum, which leads to eccentricity and orientation (i.e., inclination) oscillations. The orbits' eccentricity can reach extreme values, leading to a nearly radial motion, which can further evolve into short orbit periods and merging binaries. Furthermore, the orbits' mutual inclinations may change dramatically from pure prograde to pure retrograde, leading to misalignment and a wide range of inclinations. This dynamical behavior is coined the ``eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism.'' The behavior of such a system is exciting, rich, and chaotic in nature. Furthermore, these dynamics are accessible from a large part of the triple-body parameter space and can be applied to a diverse range of astrophysical settings and used to gain insights into many puzzles.},

  abstract = {Tidal perturbation of a circumstellar disc by a companion on an inclined circular orbit in a binary system of T Tauri stars is studied. The two stars have comparable masses and we suppose that the separation of the system is large enough compared to the radius of the disc to allow a linear analysis. In this paper we concentrate on the tidally induced angular momentum transport in the disc arising from (m=1) bending waves that are excited by potential perturbations with odd symmetry with respect to reflection in the disc mid-plane. These are of interest because they have a long wavelength which may in some cases by a significant fraction of the radius. Then propagation to the inner regions of the disc is facilitated. We calculate the response of the disc to tidal perturbations with both zero and non-zero perturbing frequencies. We expect the response to the zero-frequency term to be an approximate rigid body precession if the sound crossing time turns out to be short compared to the precession period. The response to the non-zero frequencies comprises long-wavelength waves excited at the outer edge of the disc and which propagate inwards transporting negative angular momentum with, in the inviscid case, an associated conserved wave action. Such conservation implies that the wave amplitude increases as it propagates inwards until non-linear effects become important and cause the wave to damp. Because the perturber rotates external to, and more slowly than, the disc, on dissipation of the wave, angular momentum is transferred from the disc to the companion, increasing the accretion rate on to the central star. If non-linear dissipation can produce a slowly decreasing wave action as the disc centre is approached, it is possible that tidal effects could induce an accretion rate which is of the order of typical accretion rates in classical T Tauri stars (namely between 10{\textasciicircum}-9 and 10{\textasciicircum}-7 M\_solar yr{\textasciicircum}-1). As long as the response of the disc is wave-like, the wave angular momentum flux induced in our model discs tends to increase with increasing separation of the binary system. This is at least in part due to the fact that the response of the disc has an increasing wavelength with increasing separation. The torque exerted by the perturber on the disc leads to the evolution of the relative inclination of the disc and the orbital planes, but not necessarily towards coplanarity. In some cases, the only stable equilibrium position of the system does not correspond to coplanarity. The time-scale for this evolution is of the order of magnitude of the time needed by tidal effects to remove the angular momentum content of the disc. We conclude that, when the orbit is highly inclined with respect to the disc, tidal effects may play a significant role in the accretion process in the circumprimary disc.},

Large warps can break the disc, producing multiple observational signatures. In this work, we use comparisons of disc time-scales to derive updated formulae for disc breaking, with better predictions as to when and where a disc is expected to break and how many breaks could occur. Disc breaking is more likely for discs with small inner cavities, cooler temperatures, and steeper power-law profiles, such that thin, polar-aligning discs are more likely to break. We test our analytical formulae using three-dimensional grid-based simulations of protoplanetary discs warped by the gravitational torque of an inner binary. We reproduce the expected warp behaviours in different viscosity regimes and observe disc breaking at locations in agreement with our derived equations. As our simulations only show disc breaking when disc viscosity is low, we also consider a viscous criterion for disc breaking, where rapid alignment to the precession vector can prevent a break by reducing the maximum misalignment between neighbouring rings. We apply these results to the GW Orionis circumtriple disc and find that the precession induced from the central stars can break the disc if it is relatively thin. We expect repeated or multiple disc breaking to occur for discs with sufficiently steep power-law profiles. We simulate a polar-aligning disc around an eccentric binary with steep power-law profiles and observe two separate breaking events at locations in rough agreement with our analytical predictions.},

However recent observations of young protoplanetary discs with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array have revealed that discs with large-scale spiral structure are rarely observed in the midplane. Instead, axisymmetric discs, with some also having ring and gap structures, are more commonly observed. Our work invloving warps, non-coplanar disk structures that are expected to commonly occur in young discs, potentially resolves this discrepancy between observations and theoretical predictions. We demonstrate that they are able to suppress the large-scale spiral structure of self-gravitating protoplanetary discs.},

We show that the alignment process of an initially misaligned circumbinary disc around an eccentric orbit binary is significantly different than around a circular orbit binary and involves tilt oscillations. The more eccentric the binary, the larger the tilt oscillations and the longer it takes to damp these oscillations. A circumbinary disc that is only mildly inclined may increase its inclination by a factor of a few before it moves towards alignment. The results of the SPH simulations agree well with those of linear theory. We investigate the properties of the circumbinary disc/ring around KH 15D. We determine disc properties based on the observational constraints imposed by the changing binary brightness. We find that the inclination is currently at a local minimum and will increase substantially before settling to coplanarity. In addition, the nodal precession is currently near its most rapid rate. The recent observations that show a reappearance of star B impose constraints on the thickness of the layer of obscuring material. Our results suggest that disc solids have undergone substantial inward drift and settling towards to disc mid-plane. For disc masses {$\sim$}0.001 M{$\odot$}, our model indicates that the level of disc turbulence is low ({$\alpha$} {$\ll$} 0.001). Another possibility is that the disc/ring contains little gas.},

An initially inclined non-polar debris ring or disc will not remain flat and will not evolve to a polar configuration, due to the effects of differential nodal precession that alter its flat structure. However, a gas disc with embedded well coupled solids around the eccentric binary may evolve to a polar configuration as a result of pressure forces that maintain the disc flatness and as a result of viscous dissipation that allows the disc to increase its tilt. Once the gas disc disperses, the debris disc is in a polar aligned state in which there is little precession. We use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, linear theory, and particle dynamics to study the evolution of a misaligned circumbinary gas disc and explore the effects of the initial disc tilt, mass, and size. We find that for a wide range of parameter space, the polar alignment time-scale is shorter than the lifetime of the gas disc. Using the observed level of alignment of 3{$^\circ$} from polar, we place an upper limit on the mass of the gas disc of about \$0.014 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ at the time of gas dispersal. We conclude that the polar debris disc around 99 Her can be explained as the result of an initially moderately inclined gas disc with embedded solids.

As stellar irradiation is the primary heating source for the outer PPDs, the presence of such shadows thus suggests inhomogeneous heating of the outer disk in azimuth, leading to a "thermal forcing" with dynamical consequences. We conduct a suite of idealized two-dimensional disk simulations of the outer disk with azimuthally varying cooling prescription to mimic the effect of shadows, generally assuming the shadow is static or slowly rotating. The linear response to such shadows is two-armed spirals with the same pattern speed as the shadow. Toward the nonlinear regime, we find that shadows can potentially lead to the formation of a variety of types of substructures including rings, spirals, and crescents, depending on viscosity, cooling time, etc. We have conducted systematic and statistical characterization of the simulation suite, and as thermal forcing from the shadow strengthens, the dominant form of shadow-induced disk substructures change from spirals to rings, and eventually to crescents/vortices. Our results highlight the importance of properly modeling the dynamical impact of inhomogeneous stellar irradiation, while calling for more detailed modeling incorporating more realistic disk physics.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the question of the large-scale gravitational stability of an arbitrary, highly flattened stellar system, which is assumed initially to rotate in approximate equilibrium between its self-gravitation and the centrifugal forces. It is concluded that no such disk, if fairly smooth or uniform, can be entirely stable against a tendency to form massive condensations within its own plane, unless the root-mean-square random velocities of its constituents, in the directions parallel to that plane, are everywhere sufficiently large. Lacking such random motions, it is shown that the system must be vulnerable to numerous unstable disturbances, the dimensions of which may approach its over-all radius, and whose times of growth are to be reckoned in fractions of the typical periods of revolution. The minimum root-mean-square radial velocity dispersion required in any one vicinity for the complete suppression of all axisymmetric instabilities is calculated (in collaboration with A. Kalnajs) as 3.36 G /K, where G is the gravitational constant, and and K are the local values of the projected stellar density and the epicyclic frequency, respectively. From that, and the observed j\# and K, together with their uncertainties, this minimum for the solar neighborhood of our Galaxy is estimated to fall between 20 and 35 k /sec, a range which indeed encompasses the actual radial velocity dispersions of the most predominant types of stars in our vicinity. It is pointed out that both this curious agreement, and also the well-known discrepancy between the z- and r-velocity dispersions at least of the older disk stars, may be explainable in terms of past instabilities of this galactic disk.},

In a recent study of the dynamics of planetesimals in the quadruple star system HD 98800, there were significant numbers of stable particles in circumbinary polar orbits about the inner binary pair which are apparently able to evade the Kozai instability. Here, we isolate this feature and investigate the dynamics through numerical and analytical models. The results show that the Kozai mechanism of the outer star is disrupted by a nodal libration induced by the inner binary pair on a shorter time-scale. By empirically modelling the period of the libration, a criteria for determining the high-inclination stability limits in general triple systems is derived. The nodal libration feature is interesting and, although affecting inclination and node only, shows many parallels to the Kozai mechanism. This raises the possibility that high-inclination planets and asteroids may be able to survive in multistellar systems.},

  abstract = {Most Sun-like stars in the Galaxy reside in gravitationally bound pairs of stars (binaries). Although long anticipated, the existence of a `circumbinary planet' orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitively established until the discovery of the planet transiting (that is, passing in front of) Kepler-16. Questions remained, however, about the prevalence of circumbinary planets and their range of orbital and physical properties. Here we report two additional transiting circumbinary planets: Kepler-34 (AB)b and Kepler-35 (AB)b, referred to here as Kepler-34 b and Kepler-35 b, respectively. Each is a low-density gas-giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars. Kepler-34 b orbits two Sun-like stars every 289 days, whereas Kepler-35 b orbits a pair of smaller stars (89\% and 81\% of the Sun's mass) every 131 days. The planets experience large multi-periodic variations in incident stellar radiation arising from the orbital motion of the stars. The observed rate of circumbinary planets in our sample implies that more than {\textasciitilde}1\% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearly coplanar orbits, yielding a Galactic population of at least several million.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We report on the properties of eclipsing binaries (EBs) from the Kepler mission with a newly developed photometric modelling code, which uses the light curve, spectral energy distribution of each binary, and stellar evolution models to infer stellar masses without the need for radial velocity (RV) measurements. We present solutions and posteriors to orbital and stellar parameters for 728 systems, forming the largest homogeneous catalogue of full Kepler binary parameter estimates to date. Using comparisons to published RV measurements, we demonstrate that the inferred properties (e.g. masses) are reliable for well-detached main-sequence (MS) binaries, which make up the majority of our sample. The fidelity of our inferred parameters degrades for a subset of systems not well described by input isochrones, such as short-period binaries that have undergone interactions, or binaries with post-MS components. Additionally, we identify 35 new systems which show evidence of eclipse timing variations, perhaps from apsidal motion due to binary tides or tertiary companions. We plan to subsequently use these models to search for and constrain the presence of circumbinary planets in Kepler EB systems.},

  abstract = {It is usually thought that viscous torque works to align a circumbinary disc with the binary's orbital plane. However, recent numerical simulations suggest that the disc may evolve to a configuration perpendicular to the binary orbit ('polar alignment) if the binary is eccentric and the initial disc-binary inclination is sufficiently large. We carry out a theoretical study on the long-term evolution of inclined discs around eccentric binaries, calculating the disc warp profile and dissipative torque acting on the disc. For discs with aspect ratio H/r larger than the viscosity parameter {$\alpha$}, bending wave propagation effectively makes the disc precess as a quasi-rigid body, while viscosity acts on the disc warp and twist to drive secular evolution of the disc-binary inclination. We derive a simple analytic criterion (in terms of the binary eccentricity and initial disc orientation) for the disc to evolve towards polar alignment with the eccentric binary. When the disc has a non-negligible angular momentum compared to the binary, the final 'polar alignment' inclination angle is reduced from 90{$^\circ$}. For typical protoplanetary disc parameters, the time-scale of the inclination evolution is shorter than the disc lifetime, suggesting that highly inclined discs and planets may exist orbiting eccentric binaries.},

  abstract = {Shadows are often observed in transition disks, which can result from obscuring by materials closer to the star, such as a misaligned inner disk. While shadows leave apparent darkened emission as observational signatures, they have significant dynamical impact on the disk. We carry out 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to study shadows in transition disks and find that the temperature drop due to the shadow acts as an asymmetric driving force, leading to spirals in the cavity. These spirals have zero pattern speed following the fixed shadow. The pitch angle is given by tan-1(c s /v {$\phi$} ) (6{$^\circ$} if h/r = 0.1). These spirals transport mass through the cavity efficiently, with {$\alpha$} {$\sim$} 10-2 in our simulation. Besides spirals, the cavity edge can also form vortices and flocculent streamers. When present, these features could disturb the shadow-induced spirals. By carrying out Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, we show that these features resemble those observed in near-infrared scattered light images. In the vertical direction, the vertical gravity is no longer balanced by the pressure gradient alone. Instead, an azimuthal convective acceleration term balances the gravity--pressure difference, leading to azimuthally periodic upward and downward gas motion reaching 10\% of the sound speed, which can be probed by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array line observations.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks can exhibit asymmetric temperature variations due to phenomena such as shadows cast by the inner disk or localized heating by young planets. We have performed both linear analyses and hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the disk perturbations induced by these asymmetric temperature variations. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of temperature variations share similarities with those caused by external potentials. Specifically, rotating temperature variations launch steady spiral structures at Lindblad resonances, which corotate with the temperature patterns. When the cooling time exceeds the orbital period, these spiral structures are significantly weakened. Then, depending on the boundary condition, a checkerboard pattern can appear. We provide expressions for the amplitudes of the resulting density and velocity perturbations, primarily determined by the magnitude of the temperature variations. Notably, a temperature variation of about 10{\textbackslash}\% can induce spirals with density perturbation amplitudes of order unity, comparable to those generated by a thermal mass planet. The coupling between temperature variations and spirals outside the resonances leads to a radially varying angular momentum flux, which could result in efficient ring formation within the disk. We speculate that spirals induced by temperature variations may contribute to disk accretion. Overall, considering that irradiation determines the temperature structure of protoplanetary disks, the change of irradiation both spatially or/and temporarily may produce observable effects in protoplanetary disks, especially spirals in outer disks beyond tens of AU.},

Many studies revealing these disk structures have focused on objects around single stars and disks in isolation. The scenario is more complex if binarity or multiplicity is involved; most stars are part of multiple systems in crowded star-forming regions. How does the presence of one or more stellar companions affect the shape and size of the circumstellar disks? Here we review the landscape of results from optical, infrared, and (sub-) millimeter observations of the effects of multiplicity on protoplanetary disks, emphasizing the demographic studies of nearby molecular clouds and the high-resolution studies of multiple disk systems.},
