  abstract = {A test particle orbit around an eccentric binary has two stationary states in which there is no nodal precession: coplanar and polar. Nodal precession of a misaligned test particle orbit centres on one of these stationary states. A low-mass circumbinary disc undergoes the same precession and moves towards one of these states through dissipation within the disc. For a massive particle orbit, the stationary polar alignment occurs at an inclination less than 90{$^\circ$}, which is the prograde-polar stationary inclination. A sufficiently high angular momentum particle has an additional higher inclination stationary state, the retrograde-polar stationary inclination. Misaligned particle orbits close to the retrograde-polar stationary inclination are not nested like the orbits close to the other stationary points. We investigate the evolution of a gas disc that begins close to the retrograde-polar stationary inclination. With hydrodynamical disc simulations, we find that the disc moves through the unnested crescent shape precession orbits and eventually moves towards the prograde-polar stationary inclination, thus increasing the parameter space over which circumbinary discs move towards polar alignment. If protoplanetary discs form with an isotropic orientation relative to the binary orbit, then polar discs may be more common than coplanar discs around eccentric binaries, even for massive discs. This has implications for the alignment of circumbinary planets.},

  abstract = {We investigate the evolution of low mass (Md/Mb = 0.005) misaligned gaseous discs around eccentric supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. These are expected to form from randomly oriented accretion events on to a SMBH binary formed in a galaxy merger. When expanding the interaction terms between the binary and a circular ring to quadrupole order and averaging over the binary orbit, we expect four non-precessing disc orientations: aligned or counter-aligned with the binary, or polar orbits around the binary eccentricity vector with either sense of rotation. All other orientations precess around either of these, with the polar precession dominating for high eccentricity. These expectations are borne out by smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of initially misaligned viscous circumbinary discs, resulting in the formation of polar rings around highly eccentric binaries in contrast to the coplanar discs around circular binaries. Moreover, we observe disc tearing and violent interactions between differentially precessing rings in the disc significantly disrupting the disc structure and causing gas to fall on to the binary with little angular momentum. While accretion from a polar disc may not promote SMBH binary coalescence (solving the `final-parsec problem'), ejection of this infalling low-angular momentum material via gravitational slingshot is a possible mechanism to reduce the binary separation. Moreover, this process acts on dynamical rather than viscous time-scales, and so is much faster.},

  abstract = {Some evolved binaries, namely post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) binaries, are surrounded by stable and massive circumbinary disks similar to protoplanetary disks found around young stars. Around 10\% of these disks are transition disks: they have a large inner cavity in the dust. Previous interferometric measurements and modeling have ruled out these cavities being formed by dust sublimation and suggested that they are due to massive circumbinary planets that trap dust in the disk and produce the observed depletion of refractory elements on the surfaces of the post-AGB stars. In this study, we test an alternative scenario in which the large cavities could be due to dynamical truncation from the inner binary. We performed near-infrared interferometric observations with the CHARA Array on the archetype of such a transition disk around a post-AGB binary: AC Her. We detect the companion at ten epochs over 4 yr and determine the three-dimensional orbit using these astrometric measurements in combination with a radial velocity time series. This is the first astrometric orbit constructed for a post-AGB binary system. We derive the best-fit orbit with a semimajor axis of 2.01 {\textpm} 0.01 mas (2.83 {\textpm} 0.08 au), inclination (142.9 {\textpm} 1.1){$^\circ$}, and longitude of the ascending node (155.1 {\textpm} 1.8){$^\circ$}. We find that the theoretical dynamical truncation and dust sublimation radii are at least {\textasciitilde}3{\texttimes} smaller than the observed inner disk radius ({\textasciitilde}21.5 mas or 30 au). This strengthens the hypothesis that the origin of the cavity is due to the presence of a circumbinary planet.},

  abstract = {We consider the dynamics of a protostellar disc in a binary system where the disc is misaligned with the orbital plane of the binary, with the aim of determining the observational consequences for such systems. The disc wobbles with a period approximately equal to half the orbital period of the binary and precesses on a longer time-scale. We determine the characteristic time-scale for realignment of the disc with the orbital plane as a result of dissipation. If the dissipation is determined by a simple isotropic viscosity then we find, in line with previous studies, that the alignment time-scale is of the order of the viscous evolution time-scale. However, for typical protostellar disc parameters, if the disc tilt exceeds the opening angle of the disc, then tidally induced shearing within the disc is transonic. In general, hydrodynamic instabilities associated with the internally driven shear result in extra dissipation that is expected to drastically reduce the alignment time-scale. For large disc tilts the alignment time-scale is then comparable with the precession time-scale, while for smaller tilt angles {$\delta$}, the alignment time-scale varies as (sin {$\delta$})-1. We discuss the consequences of the wobbling, precession and rapid realignment for observations of protostellar jets and the implications for binary star formation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {All circumbinary planets (CBPs) currently detected are in orbits that are almost coplanar to the binary orbit. While misaligned CBPs are more difficult to detect, observations of polar-aligned circumbinary gas and debris disks around eccentric binaries suggest that polar planet formation may be possible. A polar-aligned planet has a stable orbit that is inclined by 90{$^\circ$} to the orbital plane of the binary with an angular momentum vector that is aligned to the binary eccentricity vector. With n-body simulations we model polar terrestrial planet formation using hydrodynamic gas disk simulations to motivate the initial particle distribution. Terrestrial planet formation around an eccentric binary is more likely in a polar alignment than in a coplanar alignment. Similar planetary systems form in a polar alignment around an eccentric binary and a coplanar alignment around a circular binary. The polar planetary systems are stable even with the effects of general relativity. Planetary orbits around an eccentric binary exhibit tilt and eccentricity oscillations at all inclinations; however, the oscillations are larger in the coplanar case than the polar case. We suggest that polar-aligned terrestrial planets will be found in the future.},

In this paper, we propose a different point of view on the problem by looking first at the restricted problem where the massless particle is the outer body. In this situation, equilibria at high mutual inclination appear, which corresponds to the population of stable particles that Verrier \& Evans find in stable, high-inclination circumbinary orbits around one of the components of the quadruple star HD 98800. We provide a simple analytical framework using a vectorial formalism for these situations. We also look at the evolution of these high-inclination equilibria in the non-restricted case.},

  abstract = {The Kepler satellite has discovered a number of transiting planets around close binary stars. These circumbinary systems have highly aligned planetary and binary orbits. In this paper, we explore how the mutual inclination between the planetary and binary orbits may reflect the physical conditions of the assembly of protoplanetary disks and the interaction between protostellar binaries and circumbinary disks. Given the turbulent nature of star-forming molecular clouds, it is possible that the gas falling onto the outer region of a circumbinary disk and the central protostellar binary have different axes of rotation. Thus, the newly assembled circumbinary disk can be misaligned with respect to the binary. However, the gravitational torque from the binary produces a warp and twist in the disk, and the back-reaction torque tends to align the disk and the binary orbital plane. We present a new, analytic calculation of this alignment torque and show that the binary-disk inclination angle can be reduced appreciably after the binary accretes a few percent of its mass from the disk. Our calculation suggests that in the absence of other disturbances, circumbinary disks and planets around close (sub-AU) stellar binaries, for which mass accretion onto the proto-binary is very likely to have occurred, are expected to be highly aligned with the binary orbits, while disks and planets around wide binaries can be misaligned. Measurements of the mutual inclinations of circumbinary planetary systems can provide a clue to the birth environments of such systems.},

In this paper, we study the long-term evolution of disc warp and precession for discs with dimensionless thickness H/r larger than their viscosity parameter {$\alpha$}, such that bending waves can propagate and dominate the warp evolution. For small warps, these discs undergo approximately rigid-body precession. We derive analytical expressions for the warp/twist profiles of the disc and the alignment time-scale for a variety of models. Applying our results to circumbinary discs, we find that these discs align with the orbital plane of the binary on a time-scale comparable to the global precession time of the disc, and typically much smaller than its viscous time-scale. We discuss the implications of our finding for the observations of misaligned circumbinary discs (such as KH 15D) and circumbinary planetary systems (such as Kepler-413); these observed misalignments provide useful constraints on the uncertain aspects of the disc warp theory. On the other hand, we find that circumstellar discs can maintain large misalignments with respect to the plane of the binary companion over their entire lifetime. We estimate that inclination angles larger than {$\sim$}20{$^\circ$} can be maintained for typical disc parameters. Overall, our results suggest that while highly misaligned circumstellar discs in binaries are expected to be common, such misalignments should be rare for circumbinary discs. These expectations are consistent with current observations of protoplanetary discs and exoplanets in binaries, and can be tested with future observations.},

  abstract = {Context. Many post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars in binary systems have an infrared (IR) excess arising from a dusty circumbinary disk. The disk formation, current structure, and further evolution are, however, poorly understood. Aims: We aim to constrain the structure of the circumstellar material around the post-AGB binary and RV Tauri pulsator AC Her. We want to constrain the spatial distribution of the amorphous and of the crystalline dust. Methods: We present very high-quality mid-IR interferometric data that were obtained with the MIDI/VLTI instrument. We analyze the MIDI visibilities and differential phases in combination with the full spectral energy distribution, using the MCMax radiative transfer code, to find a good structure model of AC Her's circumbinary disk. We include a grain size distribution and midplane settling of dust self-consistently in our models. The spatial distribution of crystalline forsterite in the disk is investigated with the mid-IR features, the 69 {$\mu$}m band and the 11.3 {$\mu$}m signatures in the interferometric data. Results: All the data are well fitted by our best model. The inclination and position angle of the disk are precisely determined at i = 50 {\textpm} 8{$^\circ$} and PA = 305 {\textpm} 10{$^\circ$}. We firmly establish that the inner disk radius is about an order of magnitude larger than the dust sublimation radius. The best-fit dust grain size distribution shows that significant grain growth has occurred, with a significant amount of mm-sized grains now being settled to the midplane of the disk. A large total dust mass {$\geq$}10-3 M{$\odot$} is needed to fit the mm fluxes. By assuming {$\alpha$}turb = 0.01, a good fit is obtained with a small grain size power law index of 3.25, combined with a small gas/dust ratio {$\leq$}10. The resulting gas mass is compatible with recent estimates employing direct gas diagnostics. The spatial distribution of the forsterite is different from the amorphous dust, as more warm forsterite is needed in the surface layers of the inner disk. Conclusions: The disk in the AC Her system is in a very evolved state, as shown by its small gas/dust ratio and large inner hole. Mid-IR interferometry offers unique constraints, complementary to mid-IR features, for studying the mineralogy in disks. A better uv coverage is needed to constrain in detail the distribution of the crystalline forsterite in the disk of AC Her, but we find strong similarities with the protoplanetary disk HD 100546.

  abstract = {Eccentricity of wide binaries is difficult to measure due to their long orbital periods. With Gaia's high-precision astrometric measurements, eccentricity of a wide binary can be constrained by the angle between the separation vector and the relative velocity vector (the v-r angle). In this paper, by using the v-r angles of wide binaries in Gaia Early Data Release 3, we develop a Bayesian approach to measure the eccentricity distribution as a function of binary separations. Furthermore, we infer the eccentricities of individual wide binaries and make them publicly available. Our results show that the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries at 102 AU is close to uniform and becomes superthermal at {$>$}103 AU, suggesting two formation mechanisms dominating at different separation regimes. The close binary formation, most likely disc fragmentation, results in a uniform eccentricity distribution at {$<$}102 AU. The wide binary formation that leads to highly eccentric wide binaries at {$>$}103 AU may be turbulent fragmentation and/or the dynamical unfolding of compact triples. With Gaia, measuring eccentricities is now possible for a large number of wide binaries, opening a new window to understanding binary formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {We present resolved Herschel images of a circumbinary debris disc in the 99 Herculis system. The primary is a late F-type star. The binary orbit is well characterized and we conclude that the disc is misaligned with the binary plane. Two different models can explain the observed structure. The first model is a ring of polar orbits that move in a plane perpendicular to the binary pericentre direction. We favour this interpretation because it includes the effect of secular perturbations and the disc can survive for Gyr time-scales. The second model is a misaligned ring. Because there is an ambiguity in the orientation of the ring, which could be reflected in the sky plane, this ring either has near-polar orbits similar to the first model or has a 30{$^\circ$} misalignment. The misaligned ring, interpreted as the result of a recent collision, is shown to be implausible from constraints on the collisional and dynamical evolution. Because disc+star systems with separations similar to 99 Herculis should form coplanar, possible formation scenarios involve either a close stellar encounter or binary exchange in the presence of circumstellar and/or circumbinary discs. Discovery and characterization of systems like 99 Herculis will help understand processes that result in planetary system misalignment around both single and multiple stars.},

  abstract = {Nearly all young stars are initially surrounded by `protoplanetary' disks of gas and dust, and in the case of single stars at least 30\% of these disks go on to form planets1. The process of protoplanetary disk formation can result in initial misalignments, where the disk orbital plane is different from the stellar equator in single-star systems, or different from the binary orbital plane in systems with two stars2. A quirk of the dynamics means that initially misaligned `circumbinary' disks---those that surround two stars---are predicted to evolve to one of two possible stable configurations: one where the disk and binary orbital planes are coplanar and one where they are perpendicular (a `polar' configuration)3-5. Previous work has found coplanar circumbinary disks6, but no polar examples were known until now. Here, we report the first discovery of a protoplanetary circumbinary disk in the polar configuration, supporting the predictions that such disks should exist. The disk shows some characteristics that are similar to disks around single stars, and that are attributed to dust growth. Thus, the first stages of planet formation appear able to proceed in polar circumbinary disks.},

  abstract = {Context. Young multiple stellar systems can host both circumstellar and circumbinary discs composed of gas and dust, and the orientations of circumbinary discs can be sculpted by the orientation and eccentricity of the central binaries. Studying multiple binary systems and their associated discs enables our understanding of the size and distribution of the planetary systems that subsequently form around them. Aims: A deep ({\textasciitilde}70\%) and extended ({\textasciitilde}150 days) eclipse was seen towards the young multiple stellar system V773 Tau in 2010. We interpret it as being due to the passage of a circumbinary disc around the B components moving in front of the A components. Our aim is to characterise the orientation and structure of the disc, to refine the orbits of the sub-components, and to predict when the next eclipse will occur. Methods: We combined the photometry from several ground-based surveys, constructed a model for the light curve of the eclipse, and used high angular resolution imaging to refine the orbits of the three spatially resolved components of the system: A, B, and C. A frequency analysis of the light curves, including from the TESS satellite, enabled the characterisation of the rotational periods of the Aa and Ab stars. Results: A toy model of the circumbinary disc shows that it extends out to approximately 5 au around the B binary and has an inclination of 73{$^\circ$} with respect to the orbital plane of AB, where the lower bound of the radius of the disc is constrained by the geometry of the AB orbit and the upper bound is set by the stability of the disc. We identify several frequencies in the photometric data that we attribute to rotational modulation of the Aa and Ab stellar companions. We produced the first determination of the orbit of the more distant C component around the AB system and limited its inclination to 93{$^\circ$}. Conclusions: The high inclination and large diameter of the disc, together with the expected inclination of the disc from theory, suggest that B is an almost equal-mass, moderately eccentric binary. We identify the rotational periods of the Aa and Ab stars and a third frequency in the light curve that we attribute to the orbital period of the stars in the B binary. We predict that the next eclipse will occur around 2037, during which both detailed photometric and spectroscopic monitoring will characterise the disc in greater detail.

When the ratio of the semi-major axes of the asteroid and Jupiter takes a very small value, the solutions are expressed by elliptic functions. When the z component of the angular momentum (that is, Delaunay's H) of the asteroid is smaller than a certain limiting value, there are both a stationary solution and solutions corresponding to libration cases. The limiting value of H increases as the ratio of the semimajor axes increases, i.e., the corresponding limiting inclination drops from 39.2{$^\circ$} to 1.8{$^\circ$} as the ratio of the axes increases from 0.0 to 0.95.},

  abstract = {We consider the dynamics of a protostellar disk surrounding a star in a circular-orbit binary system. Our aim is to determine whether, if the disk is initially tilted with respect to the plane of the binary orbit, the inclination of the system will increase or decrease with time. The problem is conveniently formulated in the binary frame in which the tidal potential of the companion star is static. We may then consider a steady, flat disk that is aligned with the binary plane and investigate its linear stability with respect to tilting or warping perturbations. The dynamics is controlled by the competing effects of the m=0 and m=2 azimuthal Fourier components of the tidal potential. In the presence of dissipation, the m=0 component causes alignment of the system, while the m=2 component has the opposite tendency. We find that disks that are sufficiently large, in particular those that extend to their tidal truncation radii, are generally stable and will therefore tend to alignment with the binary plane on a timescale comparable to that found in previous studies. However, the effect of the m=2 component is enhanced in the vicinity of resonances where the outer radius of the disk is such that the natural frequency of a global bending mode of the disk is equal to twice the binary orbital frequency. Under such circumstances, the disk can be unstable to tilting and acquire a warped shape, even in the absence of dissipation. The outer radius corresponding to the primary resonance is always smaller than the tidal truncation radius. For disks smaller than the primary resonance, the m=2 component may be able to cause a very slow growth of inclination through the effect of a near resonance that occurs close to the disk center. We discuss these results in the light of recent observations of protostellar disks in binary systems.},

Dissipation within the disk causes the oscillations to damp. The process operates above a critical initial misalignment angle that depends upon the eccentricity of the binary and the mass of the disk. For binary eccentricity of 0.5, the process operates typically for disk masses smaller than a few percent of the binary mass and initial tilt angle of more than 40{$^\circ$}.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             An initially sufficiently misaligned low-mass protoplanetary disc around an eccentric binary undergoes damped nodal oscillations of tilt angle and longitude of ascending node. Dissipation causes evolution towards a stationary state of polar alignment in which the disc lies perpendicular to the binary orbital plane with angular momentum aligned to the eccentricity vector of the binary. We use hydrodynamic simulations and analytical methods to investigate how the mass of the disc affects this process. The simulations suggest that a disc with non-zero mass settles into a stationary state in the frame of the binary, the generalized polar state, at somewhat lower levels of misalignment with respect to the binary orbital plane, in agreement with the analytical model. Provided that discs settle into this generalized polar state, the observational determination of the misalignment angle and binary properties can be used to determine the mass of a circumbinary disc. We apply this constraint to the circumbinary disc in HD 98800. We obtain analytical criteria for polar alignment of a circumbinary ring with mass that approximately agree with the simulation results. Very broad misaligned discs undergo breaking, but the inner regions at least may still evolve to a polar state. The long-term evolution of the disc depends on the evolution of the binary eccentricity that we find tends to decrease. Although the range of parameters required for polar alignment decreases somewhat with increasing disc mass, such alignment appears possible for a broad set of initial conditions expected in protostellar circumbinary discs.},

In this approximation, the energy of each orbit is separately conserved, and therefore the two semimajor axes are constants. On timescales much larger than the orbital periods, the orbits exchange angular momentum, which leads to eccentricity and orientation (i.e., inclination) oscillations. The orbits' eccentricity can reach extreme values, leading to a nearly radial motion, which can further evolve into short orbit periods and merging binaries. Furthermore, the orbits' mutual inclinations may change dramatically from pure prograde to pure retrograde, leading to misalignment and a wide range of inclinations. This dynamical behavior is coined the ``eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism.'' The behavior of such a system is exciting, rich, and chaotic in nature. Furthermore, these dynamics are accessible from a large part of the triple-body parameter space and can be applied to a diverse range of astrophysical settings and used to gain insights into many puzzles.},

  abstract = {We investigate the formation mechanism for the observed nearly polar aligned (perpendicular to the binary orbital plane) debris ring around the eccentric orbit binary 99 Herculis. An initially inclined non-polar debris ring or disc will not remain flat and will not evolve to a polar configuration, due to the effects of differential nodal precession that alter its flat structure. However, a gas disc with embedded well coupled solids around the eccentric binary may evolve to a polar configuration as a result of pressure forces that maintain the disc flatness and as a result of viscous dissipation that allows the disc to increase its tilt. Once the gas disc disperses, the debris disc is in a polar aligned state in which there is little precession. We use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, linear theory, and particle dynamics to study the evolution of a misaligned circumbinary gas disc and explore the effects of the initial disc tilt, mass, and size. We find that for a wide range of parameter space, the polar alignment time-scale is shorter than the lifetime of the gas disc. Using the observed level of alignment of 3{$^\circ$} from polar, we place an upper limit on the mass of the gas disc of about \$0.014 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ at the time of gas dispersal. We conclude that the polar debris disc around 99 Her can be explained as the result of an initially moderately inclined gas disc with embedded solids. Such a disc may provide an environment for the formation of polar planets.},

  abstract = {The Kozai mechanism often destabilizes high-inclination orbits. It couples changes in the eccentricity and inclination, and drives high inclination, circular orbits to low inclination, eccentric orbits. In a recent study of the dynamics of planetesimals in the quadruple star system HD 98800, there were significant numbers of stable particles in circumbinary polar orbits about the inner binary pair which are apparently able to evade the Kozai instability. Here, we isolate this feature and investigate the dynamics through numerical and analytical models. The results show that the Kozai mechanism of the outer star is disrupted by a nodal libration induced by the inner binary pair on a shorter time-scale. By empirically modelling the period of the libration, a criteria for determining the high-inclination stability limits in general triple systems is derived. The nodal libration feature is interesting and, although affecting inclination and node only, shows many parallels to the Kozai mechanism. This raises the possibility that high-inclination planets and asteroids may be able to survive in multistellar systems.},

  abstract = {Most Sun-like stars in the Galaxy reside in gravitationally bound pairs of stars (binaries). Although long anticipated, the existence of a `circumbinary planet' orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitively established until the discovery of the planet transiting (that is, passing in front of) Kepler-16. Questions remained, however, about the prevalence of circumbinary planets and their range of orbital and physical properties. Here we report two additional transiting circumbinary planets: Kepler-34 (AB)b and Kepler-35 (AB)b, referred to here as Kepler-34 b and Kepler-35 b, respectively. Each is a low-density gas-giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars. Kepler-34 b orbits two Sun-like stars every 289 days, whereas Kepler-35 b orbits a pair of smaller stars (89\% and 81\% of the Sun's mass) every 131 days. The planets experience large multi-periodic variations in incident stellar radiation arising from the orbital motion of the stars. The observed rate of circumbinary planets in our sample implies that more than {\textasciitilde}1\% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearly coplanar orbits, yielding a Galactic population of at least several million.},

  abstract = {It is usually thought that viscous torque works to align a circumbinary disc with the binary's orbital plane. However, recent numerical simulations suggest that the disc may evolve to a configuration perpendicular to the binary orbit ('polar alignment) if the binary is eccentric and the initial disc-binary inclination is sufficiently large. We carry out a theoretical study on the long-term evolution of inclined discs around eccentric binaries, calculating the disc warp profile and dissipative torque acting on the disc. For discs with aspect ratio H/r larger than the viscosity parameter {$\alpha$}, bending wave propagation effectively makes the disc precess as a quasi-rigid body, while viscosity acts on the disc warp and twist to drive secular evolution of the disc-binary inclination. We derive a simple analytic criterion (in terms of the binary eccentricity and initial disc orientation) for the disc to evolve towards polar alignment with the eccentric binary. When the disc has a non-negligible angular momentum compared to the binary, the final 'polar alignment' inclination angle is reduced from 90{$^\circ$}. For typical protoplanetary disc parameters, the time-scale of the inclination evolution is shorter than the disc lifetime, suggesting that highly inclined discs and planets may exist orbiting eccentric binaries.},
