    \opening{Dear Editor Carraro, Data Editors, and Anonymous Reviewer,}

    Please find our revised manuscript alongside the below response to the reviewers report. The authors would like to thank the editor, reviewer, and data editors for their thoughtful review. Please see below for responses to the report along with the accompanying updated manuscript, where changes are marked in \textcolor{blue}{\bf blue}.

        Authors' Response
    \end{response}

    \begin{response}{
        L615: Unclear what "1/s" means. Below a second per calculation/timestep? Please specify.
    }
        We have clarified that this refers to the time to run a single simulation until it can be determined if the third body is undergoing circular precession or libration.
    \end{response}

    \begin{response}{
        L628: Sections (missing s).
    }
    This has been fixed.
    \end{response}

    \begin{response}{
        L642: At the end of the conclusions (or else at the end of the discussion), a brief discussion on how future observations could test these findings would add value to the article.
    }
        We have added a discussion about the possibility of confirming this work though observations. We propose a survey to measure the inclinations of disks in young eclipsing binary systems could reasonably constrain the polar fraction.
    \end{response}
